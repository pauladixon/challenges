what are falsey values
+ -1, 0, false, NaN, null



questions for me:
1. how do you stay up to date?
2. why you? - design-minded engineer.
3. why us?
4. what's your biggest professional achievement? small spells
5. why are you looking to leave your job? freelance lacks connectivity and community and therefore it's harder to find out what the cutting edge tech is while its happening 


prep:
1. eye contact - don't be shy and awkward
2. talk it through
3. business casual
4. video introduction - include in cover letter or resume
5. be early and bring a book - a clean coder or code complete book. the pragmatic programmer. read it while you're waiting. 


questions to ask:
1. what's the project / team i'll be on?
2. what code quality standard does the organization follow?
3. what is the best part of working here?
4. why are you interested in hiring ME?
5. final statement. - show interest, say about experience. remind why you are unique and great for the role. something to stick in the back of their head.
